    "In this assignment, we will explore the passenger list of the Titanic, as provided in a well-known [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) competition. For this assignment, we are concerned only with initial exploration. Please answer the specific questions listed below.\n",

    "The dataset is a list of passengers. The second column of the dataset is the label for each person indicating whether that person survived (1) or did not survive (0). The data is described in more detail below.\n",
